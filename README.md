PROJECT NAME:
Capstone-III---Task-Manager

DESCRIPTION
This program is intended to be used for a small company. It registers and stores usernames and passwords onto a system and lets each user add a new task, 
view all tasks and view their own tasks. Users can edit their tasks and reassign it to a different user. They can also change the due date and mark a task as complete.
The program stores all information in a txt file and displays the information clearly in the IDE.

The admin user has extra features where they can register new users and see relevant statistics based on the total
amount of tasks and users. The admin can also generate reports which display the amount of tasks and users, the percentage of tasks completed, overdue and not complete.
The user report shows how many tasks a user has assigned to them and provides data based on their tasks. Reports are written into the task_overview and user_overview.txt files.
